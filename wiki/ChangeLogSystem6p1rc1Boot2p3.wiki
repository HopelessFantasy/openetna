f19c5c4 Version info v1.2.0
9f1ef52 speedup drawer drawing
5f2a811 Spanish translation
1dab9e4 updated german translation
0826159 New icons for drawer catalogs navigation from Boombuler
31b55ef Fix a few stuff cause of packagenames from cherrypicked commits
74fab5d Added new options -System settings/Notifications-> Enable/disable the global notification counter receiver -Drawer preferences/Catalog navigation->Enable/Disable app drawer catalog navigation buttons
4bcc969 Only show alternative action buttons when other catalogs exists
3234ef4 added some new icons to toggle the category
77556ef fixed categorie rotating for other filter instances
5434753 Reverted again the catalog logic
6e7da08 Try to fix a lot of stuff reported on market developer console
e444805 Fix the custom launcher actions to not close the app drawer
0eef72e Minor ui changes
c2d9716 Make the counters stuff a bit more stateful storing the desktop items counter in the model (volatile) This grants the counters to not dissappear on rotate and allows to drag & drop apps from the drawer to the desktop without loosing the counter.
7c08149 Little counter placement fix
39de3ce Few fixes: -Fix a NPE when starting some activities without a proper componentname -Counters now are density-friendly and a little better placed -Custom shortcuts now display the counters too
ddbd9d6 Added the global counters to the app drawer too. Hopefully this is not too much overkill, cause currently i fire a notifyDataSetChanged to the adapter when a counter change is detected.
821d9c8 added new interface for drawer handling
2138b98 implemented category switching for the actionbuttons
c785359 First implementation of a global counter receiver We can configure the counter_filter.xml to listen to specific application broadcasts and update their icons with a counter. Also we listen a custom ADW broadcast so app developers can send the required information to ADW.
1988b20 Changed actionbuttons to accept a special action. Now, when you open the app drawer, the action buttons display a different icon and they can perform a different action.
8cee8d5 Fixed: issue 2348 from CM - CustomShirtCutActivity looses state on rotate
8c92707 added some LauncherActions to the blacklist, cause no need for them
4e2d41e Fix to complete the previous commit
f7caddf When filtering we may need to dispatch the "notifyDataSetChanged()" so the gridview, etc knows it needs to relayout stuff. Mainly cause of our AllAppsSlidingView hack, if it doesn't detect the adapter change, it doesn't relayout the pages.
2faa276 Add the ADW icon as default to Launcher Actions instead of leaving it to the ugly android generic one
e5a601a Fix more stupidity
5fede9a added 'open category' to the Launcher Actions
