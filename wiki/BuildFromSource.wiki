#summary How to build your image from source, and start to contribute to the project.

= Introduction =

This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 x64. The following steps are not too specific however, and you should be able to adapt them for your environment.

= Install the sdk =

Download the sdk from this page:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
unpack it somewhere safe and then add the location to your PATH.

= Get the required packages =
_NOTE: this is probably the most distribution-specific passage of the guide._


Edit your sources.list:
{{{
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
}}}

Add these entries at the end of the file:

{{{
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty multiverse
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-updates multiverse
}}}

Get the packages needed to build Android.
{{{
sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential zip curl sun-java5-jdk zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev ia32-libs x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32readline5-dev lib32z-dev
}}}

Verify you're using the right java version issuing a "java -version": it has to be 1.5.

= Get the source =

 * Follow the indications in the Source tab above. If you're not a member of the project just enter this line in a terminal:

{{{
svn checkout http://openetna.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openetna-read-only
}}}

(if you don't have it installed, you have to install the svn package).
You'll get a folder called openetna-read-only, it contains useful scripts and some READMEs. If you're autonomous enough, just follow them; if not, go on with this guide.

= Preparing for building =

{{{
cd openetna-read-only
}}}
 * Then, according the README: get smali and baksmali:
{{{
wget http://smali.googlecode.com/files/smali-1.2.4.jar
wget http://smali.googlecode.com/files/baksmali-1.2.4.jar
}}}
 * Now get the repo tool, if you haven't got it already. Also make sure you have the 'git' package installed.
{{{
wget http://android.git.kernel.org/repo
chmod +x repo
mv repo /opt/android-sdk/tools/
}}}
(note: /opt/android-sdk/tools should be in your path, otherwise add /opt/android-sdk/tools/ in front of the 'repo' commands)
 * Download the Polytheus android-2.1 source:
{{{
mkdir android-2.1
cd android-2.1
repo init -u git://github.com/OpenEtna/android_manifest.git -b eclair
repo sync
}}}

= Building the source = 
 * Now you can build the source:
{{{
./doBuild
}}}
 * Then make a boot.img:
{{{
cd my-boot
./makeBootImg
}}}
 * Then build a system.img:
{{{
cd ../my-system
less README
}}}
