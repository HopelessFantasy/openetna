#summary How to build your image from source, and start to contribute to the project.

= Introduction =

This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 x64. The following steps are not too specific however, and you should be able to adapt them for your environment.

= Install the sdk =

Download the sdk from this page:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
unpack it somewhere safe and then add the location to your PATH.

= Get the source =

Follow the indications in the Source tab above. If you're not a member of the project just enter this line in a terminal:

svn checkout http://openetna.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openetna-read-only

(if you don't have it installed, you have to install the svn package).
You'll get a folder called openetna-read-only, it contains useful scripts and some READMEs. If you're autonomous enough, just follow them; if not, go on with this guide.
