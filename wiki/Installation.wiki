= Introduction =

This document covers the flashing process of the current ROM.
The steps described in this document use fastboot to flash the new
system. fastboot is a debugging tool included in older LG firmwares.

== Requirements ==
You will need:
 * LG GW620
 * ADB (included in Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 * fastboot 
  * Linux: http://android-dls.com/files/linux/fastboot
  * Windows: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=463627 (unverified)
 * Recent system.img and boot.img from the 'Downloads' section

== When Upgrading from 1.5 ==

If you are upgrading from a v1.5 ROM you should:
 * backup all the information you want to a different medium.

= Install =

  * Get your phone in fastboot mode:
  # Remove battery
  # Slide out the keyboard
  # Plug in USB connector (still with the battery removed)
  # Press SPACE (or SPACE+MENU for newer firmwares) till the fastboot text appears on the screen
  # If you are unable to enter fastboot, your firmware may not support it. See section "Recover fastboot"

 * If you are flashing an 'OpenEtna' image for the first time, or if the ChangeLog says that you will have to do an wipe, issue the next commands (else skip this step). This will do something similar to a factory reset and remove all userdata. As root/admin, do:
{{{
fastboot -w
}}}
 * Flash the images. As root/admin, do:
{{{
fastboot flash boot bootv1.4.img
fastboot flash system systemV4.2.img
}}}
  # Wait until the commands finished
  # Unplug the usb
  # Reinsert the battery
  # Poweron the phone
  # Wait (On the first boot, the applications are optimized. This can take up to 10 minutes)

= Update the keyboard layout =
See HowToChangeKeyboardLayout

= Install Google Apps =
Download gapps-mdpi-20100930-signed.zip (google for it), copy it to your sdcard by
{{{
adb push gapps-mdpi-20100930-signed.zip /sdcard/gapps-mdpi-20100930-signed.zip
}}}
and reboot.

== Recover fastboot ==

If you have installed LG official v10I, v10N or some other version that
does not have fastboot, you should downgrade using LG Utils and
LG Mobile Update. (google for it)
