= Introduction =

This document covers the flashing process of the current ROM

= General Steps = 

The steps described in this document use fastboot to flash the new
system.

== Requirements ==
You will need:
{{{
* LG GW620
* Older firmware (not V10I, V10N, or anything recent that lacks fastboot)
* ADB (included in Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* fastboot (e.g. found here: http://android-dls.com/files/linux/fastboot)
}}}
== Recover Fastboot ==

If you have installed LG official v10I, v10N or some other version that
does not have fastboot, you should downgrade using LG Utils and
LG Mobile Update.

  * backup all the information you want to a different medium.
