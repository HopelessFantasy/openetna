= Introduction =

This document covers the flashing process of the current ROM.
The steps described in this document use fastboot to flash the new
system. fastboot is a debugging tool included in older LG firmwares.

== Requirements ==
You will need:
 * LG GW620
 * Older firmware (not V10I, V10N, or anything recent that lacks fastboot)
  * http://csmg.lgmobile.com:9002/swdata/WEBSW/GW620/ANEUBB/V10g_00/V10G_00.kdz
 * ADB (included in Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 * fastboot 
  * Linux: http://android-dls.com/files/linux/fastboot
  * Windows: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=463627 (unverified)
 * Android 2.1 ROM: 
  * System.img: http://www.zacpod.com/files/systemV4.1.zip
  * boot.img: http://code.google.com/p/openetna/downloads/detail?name=bootv1.2.img

== Recover fastboot ==

If you have installed LG official v10I, v10N or some other version that
does not have fastboot, you should downgrade using LG Utils and
LG Mobile Update. (google for it)

== When Upgrading from 1.5 ==

If you are upgrading from a v1.5 ROM you should:
 * backup all the information you want to a different medium.
