= Introduction =

This document covers the flashing process of the current ROM.
The steps described in this document use fastboot to flash the new
system. fastboot is a debugging tool included in older LG firmwares.

== Requirements ==
You will need:
 * LG GW620
 * Older firmware (not V10I, V10N, or anything recent that lacks fastboot)
  * http://csmg.lgmobile.com:9002/swdata/WEBSW/GW620/ANEUBB/V10g_00/V10G_00.kdz
 * ADB (included in Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 * fastboot 
  * Linux: http://android-dls.com/files/linux/fastboot
  * Windows: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=463627 (unverified)
 * Android 2.1 ROM: 
  * System.img: http://code.google.com/p/openetna/downloads/detail?name=systemV4.2.7z
  * boot.img: http://code.google.com/p/openetna/downloads/detail?name=bootv1.4.img

== Recover fastboot ==

If you have installed LG official v10I, v10N or some other version that
does not have fastboot, you should downgrade using LG Utils and
LG Mobile Update. (google for it)

== When Upgrading from 1.5 ==

If you are upgrading from a v1.5 ROM you should:
 * backup all the information you want to a different medium.

= Install =

 # Get your phone in fastboot mode:
  # Remove battery
  # Slide out the keyboard
  # Plug in USB connector (still with the battery removed)
  # Press SPACE (or SPACE+MENU for newer firmwares) till the fastboot text appears on the screen

 # As Root or Admin, execute the following commands on your linux terminal or windows command line interface ( WIN + R => cmd => ok )
 * If you are flashing an 'OpenEtna' image for the first time, or if the ChangeLog says that you will have to do an wipe, issue the next commands (else skip this step). This will do something similar to a factory reset and remove all userdata.

 * Flash the images
