#summary Infos about the 2.6.35 kernel
= Feature =
  * Wifi is very stable (at least for me)
  * Usb tethering works out of the box without additional apps

= High priority =
  * Change sensors.eve to support the new proximity input device. Proximity values are no longer served by the akm device. Make the other sensors usable.
  * Bluetooth does not work (use http://nohands.sourceforge.net to test)
  * Camera does not work

= Bugs =
  * Flash light does not work

= Minor =
  * Look at that "LG's hidden reset logic" in the old kernel's pm.c
  * we have brought our own compass driver in drivers/i2c/chips/akm8973.c but there is already one in drivers/misc/akm8973.c. See if we can use that.
  * usb wakelock is hold even if on wall charger
  * The powerbutton is connected to gpio 76?
  * GPIO 58 has something todo with gps?
  * Look at the latency of the home&back key (in touch_so240001.c), they seem unresponsive from time to time

= Infos =
The motion sensor is bma150, see http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language4/downloads/BST-BMA150-DS000-06.pdf for a full datasheet.
The backlight driver is a [http://www.rohm.com/products/databook/driver/pdf/bd6083gul_1-e.pdf BD6083GUL].
