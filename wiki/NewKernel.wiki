#summary Infos about the 2.6.35 kernel
= Feature =
  * Wifi is very stable (at least for me)
  * Usb tethering works out of the box without additional apps

= High priority =
  * Change sensors.eve to support the new proximity input device. Proximity values are no longer served by the akm device. Make the other sensors usable.
  * Bluetooth does not work (use http://nohands.sourceforge.net to test)
  * Camera does not work
  * Flash light does not work

= Bugs =
  * Look at that "LG's hidden reset logic" in the old kernel's pm.c
  * we have brought our own compass driver in drivers/i2c/chips/akm8973.c but there is already one in drivers/misc/akm8973.c. See if we can use that.
  * The msm_touch touchscreen driver should disable interrupts when the screen is off
  * Look at the latency of the home&back key (in touch_so240001.c), they seem unresponsive from time to time
  * Look at the correct suspend behavior of the mmc. We need something like suspend_late here, so that the wifi driver does not loose its parent.
  * When attached to usb and then entering suspend, the usb is unusable after resume. You have to unplug and plugin again. Says msm72k_udc: usb_ept_queue_xfer() tried to queue busy request
  * The powerbutton is connected to gpio 76?
  * GPIO 58 has something todo with gps?
  * mahimahi has pmem_venc, we do not
  * msm72k_udc: usb_ept_queue_xfer() tried to queue busy request
  * Device alarm failed to suspend: error -16
