#summary Infos about the 2.6.35 kernel

= Bugs =
  * Sensor does not report temperature right (stays at 36 degree)
  * Backlight of the buttons does not light up automatically (but the can be enabled by writing to /sys/devices/platform/eve-keyled/{shift,setting,enable}
  * Power button does not work, needs rpc. See arch/arm/mach-msm/rpc_server_handset.c
  * LCD backlight can not be controlled
  * Flash light does not work
  * Camera does not work
  * MMC does not work
  * Wifi does not work (needs mmc)
  * Bluetooth does not work (needs wifi)
  * Vibrator does not work (rewrite that!)
  * Kernel uses the old graphics framework
  * Rework the proximity driver drivers/input/misc/prox_sharp.c. Currently its value is read by drivers/i2c/chips/akm8973.c and then passed to sensors.eve. Do not do that! Read /sys/bus/i2c/devices/6-0044/show directly by sensors.eve.
