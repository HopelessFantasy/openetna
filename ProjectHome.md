This project wants to provide an open firmware for the LG GW620/KH5200.
We currently have an experimental android 2.2 'froyo' firmware in the Downloads section.
For instructions on installation, see the Wiki.

**The website can be found under http://openetna.com (with installation instructions, FAQ and more). If you have issues, feel free to ask them in the [forum](http://forum.openetna.com). You can find help there.**

**This project is discontinued**
