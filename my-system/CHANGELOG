    Now applications can again use root

Fixed Issue 27: directional arrows messed up (thanks saxando4u for reporting)
Fixed Issue 21: Notifications Bar issues
Fixed Issue 18: Wifi issues, will connect to wep but not wpa 
    But we have to see if my fix works for networks with only WPA or only WPA2 but not both
    If you have already configured a network in a earlier version, you have to remove it and then add it again

Security issue: Dropbear is not automatically started on boot
                You can change /system/bin/rundropbear if you want it

Fixed Issue 17: Cannot import/sync contacts
    and additionally details are now shown
    (even birthday!)
